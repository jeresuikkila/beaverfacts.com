      "fact": "A beaver’s home is called a lodge. Lodges are little dome-shaped houses made from woven sticks, grasses and moss plastered with mud.",

      "fact": "Nose and ear valves shut to keep out water while beavers are submerged, and nictitating membranes (transparent \"third eyelids\") act as goggles. Their lips close behind their oversized front teeth, allowing beavers to transport building materials and food without drowning.",

      "fact": "Some beavers have orange teeth. This is because, whereas other rodents have magnesium in their tooth enamel, beavers have iron. So beavers have orange teeth for the same reason we have red blood. The iron causes the orange colouring in beavers’ teeth, makes the teeth stronger against mechanical stress, and makes them more resistant to acid.",

    {
      "fact": "Beavers build dams for myriad reasons, and one is so that the lake behind it will grow deep enough to ensure it doesn’t freeze all the way through during the winter. This bit of temperature control is especially crucial because beavers anchor a food cache to the bottom of the lake to serve as sustenance during the cold months.",

    {
      "fact": "Beavers travel good distances from their homes to find food. If they find a good source, they build canals to the food source as a way to float the food back to their lodges. Logs and twigs are stored underwater for winter feeding.",

    {
      "fact": "A beaver’s activity is not synchronized with the typical solar day. Light levels in a beaver’s lodge and underwater remain consistently low throughout a 24-hour day. Without cues from the sun, a beaver’s circadian rhythm, or regular day cycle, changes. Its “days” become longer, often varying in length from 26-29 hours. Beavers are primarily nocturnal and tend to be most active at night.",
